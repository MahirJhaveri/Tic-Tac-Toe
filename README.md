# Tic-Tac-Toe
An online, multiplayer, highly responsive version of the popular Tic Tac Toe game, packed with exciting new features.



## What is this?
This is an open sourced version of the code I plan to get up, and live on the internet.
Currently, live at www.xand0.site

**Note** - This is the Beta version of the code which is under development and may not be identical to the buld which is currently live.


## How to run this?
This repo can be cloned and immidiately executed on the localhost(3000) without any changes, ofcourse after npm installing the dependencies.
But in order to make it accessible to anyone on the same network, you'll have to make a few changes in the code:
1. Change the PORT varaible in signup-script.js to have your local ip address.
2. Change the script src attribute to "http://{your local ip}:3000/signup-script.js"


## Built with
* **Node js** - The web framework used for the servers
* **Express js** - A npm library that makes setting up servers easy
* **pug** - A templating engine
* **Socket.io** - A framework used to allow for bi-directional data transfer between the client and the server
* and many more...
