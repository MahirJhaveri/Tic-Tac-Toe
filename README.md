# Tic-Tac-Toe
An online, multiplayer, highly responsive version of the popular Tic Tac Toe game, packed with exciting new features.



## What is this?
This is an open sourced version of the code I plan to get up, and live on the internet.
Currently, live at www.xand0.site

**Note** - This is the Beta version of the code which is under development and may not be identical to the build which is currently live.


## How to run this?
This repository can be cloned and immediately executed on the localhost:3000 without any changes, of course after using npm to install the dependencies.
But in order to make it accessible to anyone on the same network, you'll have to make a few changes in the code:
1. Change the PORT variable in signup-script.js to have your local ip address.
2. Change the script src attribute to "http://{your local ip}:3000/signup-script.js"


## Built with
* **Node js** - The web framework used for the servers
* **Express js** - A npm library that makes setting up servers easy
* **pug** - A templating engine
* **Socket.io** - A framework used to allow for bi-directional data transfer between the client and the server
* and many more...
